Welcome to the AI 4 Climate Bootcamp - Module 3: Deep Learning & TensorFlow! This repository contains materials to help you understand the fundamental concepts of deep learning and its practical implementation using TensorFlow.

## Lessons Outline

### [Week 1: Introduction to Deep Learning and TensorFlow](./Week%2001%20-%20Review%20and%20Intro%20to%20Deep%20Learning/)

In the first week, we reviewed data science and machine learning concepts and tools, and we introduced deep learning concepts and basic TensorFlow syntax. We covered the following topics:

- Introduction to deep learning.
- Building models using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
- Dense layers.
- Activation functions.
- Loss functions and optimizers.

### [Week 2: Building User Interfaces and Reproducibility](./Week%2002%20-%20Optimization%20and%20Regularization/)

In the second week, we went deeper into TensorFlow by learning about regularization techniques, building user interfaces for our models, and working on training monitoring and reproduction using Tensorboard. We covered the following topics:

- Regularization techniques (dropout and early stopping).
- Building user interfaces for models with Gradio.
- Model reproducibility.
- Training monitoring with Tensorboard.

### [Week 3: Computer Vision](./Week%2003%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Vision/)
